## Problem Statement

**Problem:**

You are tasked with creating a Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle based on the given length and width.

You have been given the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and now print the area of the rectangle

### Input:

- `length`: A number representing the length of the rectangle where length is greater than or equal to 1
- `width`: A number representing the width of the rectangle where width is greater than or equal to 1

### Output:

- print the area of the rectangle calculated as length times width

### Example:

```python
length = 5.2
width = 3.8

Output: 19.76

Explanation:

In the given example, the length of the rectangle is 5.2 units and the width is 3.8 units. The area of the rectangle is calculated as 

5.2 Ã— 3.8 = 19.76.
