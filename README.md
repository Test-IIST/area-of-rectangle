Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to create a Python program that prompts the user for the length and width of a rectangle and then calculates and prints its area.

Instructions:

    Write a Python program that does the following:
    
    Prompt the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle.
    Display the calculated area to the user.
    Ensure that the program can handle edge cases, such as when the user provides non-numeric input.

Input Constraints:
    
    The length and width should be positive numbers.
    The program should handle invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric input.

Example:
```python
Input1: Length = 5, Width = 3
Expected Output1: "The area of the rectangle is 15 square units.

Input2: Length = -2, Width = 6
Expected Output2: "Invalid input. Please provide positive numbers.

Input3: Length = 7, Width = "abc"
Expected Output3: "Invalid input. Please provide numeric values for length and width.
```
